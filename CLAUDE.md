# CLAUDE.md — Velocity Architecture Framework™
*Project memory for Claude. Read this at the start of every session before doing any work on this project.*

---

## What This Project Is

The **Velocity Architecture Framework™ (Velocity™)** is Phil Myint's primary intellectual property — a decision governance framework for enterprise and solution architecture, conformant with ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022. It is also the underlying framework for a leadership extension that applies the same ideas to any organisational authority responsible for making decisions move.

This is not a side project. It is the primary framework, IP, and publishing platform for ZenCloud Advisory. Every change must maintain the integrity of the whole.

**Core thesis:**
> *Architecture exists to create clarity that leads to better decisions.*
> *Velocity is not speed. It is the rate at which ambiguity expires.*

**Owner:** Phil Myint, Principal Architect, ZenCloud Advisory
**Trademark:** Velocity Architecture Framework™ — TM filed, Class 42, ZenCloud Consulting

## Strategic Context (Background — Not Blocking Current Work)

**OrdoAnimi** (`github.com/OrdoAnimi`) is a new institutional brand/org — a 16-component governed AI estate. Velocity Architecture is referenced within OrdoAnimi as "the professional method." ZenCloudAU repos will migrate to OrdoAnimi eventually, but this is future work. Fix the framework first, then migrate.

**Trademark note:** There are issues with the "Velocity" trademark. The framework name is stable for current work. A rename decision will be made separately; CLAUDE.md will be updated at that point.

## The Ecosystem — All Working Sites and Artefacts

### Primary Repository
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/ZenCloudAU/velocity-architecture
- **Local mirror:** `D:\VelocityArchitecture\`
- **Public site:** https://velocityarchitectureframework.com/
- **Status:** Public, v1.0

**Critical:** The repo IS the website backend. A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish-articles.yml`) runs on every push to `main` that touches `.md` files — it syncs nav/footer, lints stale anchors, and auto-generates HTML reader pages from MD files in `research/` and `publications/`. Do not push broken Markdown.

### Publishing Channels
- **velocityarchitectureframework.com/publications** — ALL 50 book chapters published + Thought Series + Signal. **This is the primary publishing platform, not Medium.**
- **Medium @ZencloudAU** — Book chapters serialised; at Chapter 30 of 50 (secondary discovery channel — 20 chapters behind)
- **LinkedIn in/pmyint** — Professional presence; active
- **zencloud.com.au** — ZenCloud Advisory client entry point

### Related Artefacts (Off-Repo)
- **Velocity™ Book** — 50 chapters complete, published on velocityarchitectureframework.com (Book 1 — Architecture domain)
- **Leadership Book** — Book 2; same Velocity™ framework, leadership language. Seed: `leadership/LEADERSHIP-EXTENSION.md`
- **The Living Bible for Enterprise & Solution Architects** — domain knowledge reference base (location TBC — confirm with Phil)
- **Presentation materials / slide decks** — exist for client and conference use (location TBC)

### Velocity™ Agent (Deprecated)
- The Velocity™ Agent ("VAF v2" in the old UI) was a separate product hosted at `velocityarchitectureframework.com/app/portal.html`
- It has been **deprecated** — the portal.html page now redirects to the framework site
- Nav links to the Agent have been removed from vaf-sa (all HTML files cleaned in Session 2)
- The agent is NOT part of the current framework or publishing stack
- Do not add links to `app/portal.html` anywhere in either repo

### Working Folders
- Local repo files: `D:\VelocityArchitecture\`
- Review file: `D:\VelocityArchitecture\REVIEW.md`
- Ecosystem audit: `D:\VelocityArchitecture\ECOSYSTEM-AUDIT.md`

## Framework Structure — What You Must Know Before Touching Anything

### The Six Viewpoints (primary operational structure)

| ID | Viewpoint | Instrument | Layer | Files |
|----|-----------|------------|-------|-------|
| VP1 | Direction | Guardrail Canvas | Enterprise | `viewpoints/vp1-direction/` |
| VP2 | Decision | Trade-off Matrix | Solution | `viewpoints/vp2-decision/` |
| VP3 | Truth | ADRs + Fitness Functions | Technical | `viewpoints/vp3-truth/` |
| VP4 | Velocity | Dashboard + ADL | Control | `viewpoints/vp4-velocity/` |
| VP5 | Rhythm | Pulse System | Operating | `viewpoints/vp5-rhythm/` |
| VP6 | Practitioner | Integrity Arc | Human | `viewpoints/vp6-practitioner/` |

### The Seven Columns (book/presentation structure — maps onto viewpoints)

| Column | Name | VP equivalent |
|--------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Trademark | Meta-level (no VP) |
| 2 | Operating Model | Foundation Layer |
| 3 | Operating Rhythm | VP5 |
| 4 | Delivery System | VP4 (ADL + Vault) |
| 5 | Architectural Control | VP4 (Dashboard) |
| 6 | Pattern & Playbook | NOT YET CREATED — gap to fill |
| 7 | Practitioner | VP6 |

**VP1, VP2, VP3 sit across Columns 2–5 in execution.** The column model is the book/teaching structure; the viewpoint model is the ISO 42010-conformant operational structure. A bridging explanation is needed in the README (tracked in REVIEW.md P1).

### Foundation Layer
`foundation/EPISTEMOLOGY.md` — sits beneath all viewpoints. Not a viewpoint itself. Contains the philosophical warrant for the entire framework.

**Eight coined concepts** (all trademarked IP):
1. Velocity of Truth
2. Integrity Gap
3. Decision Latency
4. Expiry
5. Control Paradox
6. Auctor Custos
7. Architecture Theatre
8. Responsibility Diffusion

These terms must never be altered, diluted, or used carelessly. They are the IP.

## Artefact Hierarchy and Correspondence Rules

```
Guardrail Canvas (VP1 — GC-YYYYMMDD-XXX)
    └── Trade-off Matrix (VP2 — TOM-YYYYMMDD-XXX)  [must reference governing Canvas]
            └── ADR (VP3 — ADR-NNN)                  [must reference governing TOM]
                    └── Fitness Functions              [must reference ADR or TOM]

All of the above indexed in:
    └── ADL (VP4 — adl-template.md)
            └── Velocity Dashboard (VP4 — velocity-dashboard.md)
                    └── Pulse Sessions (VP5 — pulse-system.md)
                            └── Practitioner assessment (VP6 — integrity-arc.md)
```

### Correspondence Rules (17 total — must be maintained on every change)

| ID | Rule | What it means in practice |
|----|------|--------------------------|
| CR-T1 | TOM → Canvas | Every Trade-off Matrix must reference a Guardrail Canvas |
| CR-T2 | ADR → TOM | Every ADR must reference a Trade-off Matrix |
| CR-T3 | Supersession traceability | Never delete — always supersede with a new record |
| CR-T4 | Fitness Function → ADR/TOM | Every fitness function must carry a comment reference |
| CR-E1 | 14-Day Decision Aging | Open decisions >14 days trigger mandatory escalation |
| CR-E2 | Scope compression on escalation | Escalations narrow — they never widen |
| CR-E3 | Escalation terminal condition | Every escalation carries a defined binding point |
| CR-E4 | Pulse escalation window | Max two Pulse cycles before binding |
| CR-O1 | Single named owner | No committee ownership anywhere |
| CR-O2 | Ownership Map currency | Update within 5 business days of any ownership transfer |
| CR-O3 | Practitioner scope declaration | Written scope for engagements >3 months |
| CR-L1 | Enterprise layer constraint | Canvases must not prescribe technology or solutions |
| CR-L2 | Solution layer decisiveness | TOMs must produce commitment sufficient for delivery to begin |
| CR-L3 | Technical layer feedback | VP3 findings that invalidate upstream assumptions must escalate |
| CR-L4 | No layer substitution | No layer may substitute for another |
| CR-X1 | Ambiguity lifespan | Every open question must have an expiry date |
| CR-X2 | Revisitation criteria | Decisions may only be reopened under defined conditions |
| CR-X3 | Canvas review date | Every canvas carries a Review Date; expired = inactive |

## Working Conventions

### Before Making Any Change
1. Check `REVIEW.md` — does this change address an open finding?
2. Identify which viewpoint(s) and correspondence rule(s) are affected
3. Check artefact hierarchy — does a change here require downstream updates?
4. Never delete — supersede with a new record and retain the old one
5. **If the change touches `.md` files under `research/` or `publications/`, the GitHub Actions pipeline will auto-generate HTML on push. Ensure the Markdown is clean.**

### When Creating New Artefacts
- Use the correct ID format (see Artefact ID Conventions above)
- Every new TOM must reference a Guardrail Canvas (CR-T1)
- Every new ADR must reference a TOM (CR-T2)
- Every new fitness function must carry a comment reference (CR-T4)
- Every new open question must have an expiry date (CR-X1)
- Every new decision must have a single named owner (CR-O1)

### When Editing Existing Files
- Do not modify a decided/accepted artefact — create a new one that supersedes it (CR-T3)
- Update the ADL index when any decision changes status
- Update the Velocity Dashboard ownership map within 5 business days of any ownership change (CR-O2)

### Language and Tone
- The coined terms are precise — use them exactly as defined in EPISTEMOLOGY.md
- Avoid hedging. The framework's voice is assertive. Architecture exists to produce decisions, not analysis.
- "We choose X" not "we recommend considering X"
- Every artefact is judged by one test: *Did this help someone decide?*

### Publishing Synchronisation
When content is updated in the repo, consider whether it needs to be reflected in:
- velocityarchitectureframework.com (automated for `research/` and `publications/` via GitHub Actions — manual for all other directories)
- Medium articles (especially if a coined concept definition changes)
- LinkedIn series
- The book (in `book/`)
- The Leadership Extension

Changes to coined concepts or correspondence rules are the highest-risk changes — they ripple across all publishing channels simultaneously.
