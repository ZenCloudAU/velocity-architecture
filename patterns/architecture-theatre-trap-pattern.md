## Problem

The team is producing architectural artefacts — reviews, documents, presentations, governance records — but no decisions are being made. The governance process is running. The architecture function appears active. Delivery is stalling. The artefacts document the existence of problems without resolving them.

This is Architecture Theatre: governance ceremony substituting for governance outcomes.

---

## Context

Architecture Theatre is one of the eight coined concepts in the Velocity™ framework (EPISTEMOLOGY.md). It is distinct from a stalled decision (PAT-01) or a failed escalation (PAT-02) — those are process failures. Architecture Theatre is a cultural and structural failure: the architecture function has been misconfigured to produce output rather than decisions.

The trap is hard to name because it looks like progress. Reviews are conducted. Stakeholders attend. Documents are approved. The artefact count grows. But delivery cannot proceed because no architectural decision has produced a binding commitment sufficient for delivery to begin (CR-L2).

Architecture Theatre typically appears in any of the following conditions:

- The architecture function sits outside delivery, reviewing rather than deciding
- Architecture reviews are conducted after delivery decisions have already been made informally
- The owner of each artefact is the architecture team, not a named individual who can bind the decision
- Governance is structured around artefact completion rather than decision production
- Escalation channels exist formally but are never invoked — because escalation would require naming what is not being decided

---

## Forces

**Why the trap is hard to exit without a framework response:**

1. Architecture Theatre is self-reinforcing. The more artefacts produced without binding decisions, the more the team's identity becomes tied to artefact production.
2. Stakeholders may prefer Theatre to decisions — because Theatre defers accountability.
3. The practitioner producing artefacts is not necessarily aware they are in the trap. The work feels substantive.
4. Naming the trap feels like an accusation. "You are producing theatre" is a confronting statement in a governance meeting.
5. The organisation may have invested heavily in the governance process and will resist the implication that it is not working.

## Solution

### Step 1 — Audit the decision register

Pull the ADL. For every item listed, answer: **did this artefact produce a binding commitment that changed delivery behaviour?**

A "yes" requires that:
- A named individual (CR-O1) committed to a specific option
- Delivery changed direction or confirmed direction as a result
- The commitment is recorded in the ADL with a date

If fewer than 50% of artefacts produced a binding commitment, Architecture Theatre is present. Document this finding.

### Step 2 — Identify the Theatre Vector

| Theatre vector | Indicator | Intervention |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Review after informal decision | Delivery teams say "we already know what we're doing" entering the review | Move architecture upstream — canvas before options are explored |
| No named owner | Records reference "the architecture team" as owner | Apply CR-O1 — name one individual accountable for each decision |
| Artefact-not-decision culture | Success metric is "review complete" not "decision made" | Redefine success: every review ends with a binding item or a named escalation |
| Governance theatre (attendance without authority) | Decision-makers send delegates who cannot bind | Require the decision-making authority to attend or formally delegate authority in writing |
| Missing expiry dates | Open items have no defined resolution date | Apply CR-X1 — every open question carries an expiry date |

### Step 3 — Reassert the VP1 constraint

The Guardrail Canvas (VP1) exists to prevent Theatre by establishing enterprise-level constraints *before* solution options are explored. If Theatre is present, a Canvas is either absent or was produced after the fact.

Return to Canvas-first: no Trade-off Matrix (VP2) is opened without a governing Canvas (CR-T1). This is not procedural — it is the mechanism that ensures architecture produces direction rather than documentation.

### Step 4 — Name one decision that must bind in the next Pulse

Theatre is broken by a single binding decision, not by a governance reform. Name the most consequential open decision in the ADL. Schedule a Pulse session with the required decision-maker present (not a delegate). The session has one deliverable: a binding decision with a named owner and a date.

Once one decision binds within the governance process, the process is no longer Theatre.

## Correspondence Rules Engaged

| Rule | Application |
|------|-------------|
| CR-O1 | Single named owner — every artefact must carry an individual owner, not a team |
| CR-L2 | Solution layer decisiveness — TOMs must produce commitment sufficient for delivery to begin |
| CR-T1 | TOM → Canvas — no Trade-off Matrix without a governing Canvas |
| CR-X1 | Every open question carries an expiry date |
| CR-X2 | Decisions may only be reopened under defined conditions — prevents perpetual re-litigation |

---

## Consequences

After this pattern is applied:

- The ADL contains a binary measurement of governance effectiveness (what proportion of artefacts produced binding decisions)
- At least one decision has bound within the governance process, demonstrating that the process can produce decisions
- The Canvas-first constraint (CR-T1) is in effect, preventing Theatre from re-emerging at the solution layer
- The practitioner's position is protected — the Integrity Arc (VP6) requires the practitioner to name governance failure, not participate in it

**What this does not fix:** the cultural disposition toward Theatre. That requires sustained application of the Velocity™ operating rhythm (VP5) over multiple Pulse cycles. The pattern breaks the immediate trap; the Pulse system prevents the pattern from recurring.

## Related Patterns

- **PAT-01 — Stalled Decision:** often the first symptom of Theatre — a decision has been in review so long it has ceased to be a decision item
- **PAT-02 — Escalation Failure:** Theatre sometimes masquerades as escalation — items are "escalated" into a review process rather than to a named authority with the power to bind
