# Velocity Architecture Framework™

This repository is the public knowledge base for Velocity Architecture. It contains the framework, formal specification, research, published policies, practitioner guidance, diagnostics, templates, examples and authored publications.

## Framework Structure

Velocity™ operates through two complementary structures. Understanding both is required before working with any artefact.

### Six Viewpoints — the operational structure

The framework is ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 conformant. Its operational structure is six viewpoints, each with a defined instrument, layer, and concern set.

| ID  | Viewpoint    | Instrument                 | Layer      |
|-----|--------------|----------------------------|------------|
| VP1 | Direction    | Guardrail Canvas           | Enterprise |
| VP2 | Decision     | Trade-off Matrix           | Solution   |
| VP3 | Truth        | ADRs + Fitness Functions   | Technical  |
| VP4 | Velocity     | Dashboard + ADL + Vault    | Control    |
| VP5 | Rhythm       | Pulse System               | Operating  |
| VP6 | Practitioner | Integrity Arc              | Human      |

The viewpoints define what artefacts exist, what concerns they address, and what correspondence rules govern their relationships. See [`spec/FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md`](spec/FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md) for the full conformance declaration.

### Seven Columns — the teaching and publication structure

The framework is also expressed through seven columns used in the book, presentations, and practitioner training. The columns organise the same content into a practitioner sequence rather than an ISO ontology.

| Column | Name                  | VP equivalent                  |
|--------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1      | Trademark             | Meta-level (no VP)             |
| 2      | Operating Model       | Foundation Layer               |
| 3      | Operating Rhythm      | VP5                            |
| 4      | Delivery System       | VP4 (ADL + Velocity Vault)     |
| 5      | Architectural Control | VP4 (Dashboard)                |
| 6      | Pattern & Playbook    | VP2, VP3 (applied patterns)    |
| 7      | Practitioner          | VP6                            |

VP1, VP2, and VP3 operate across Columns 2-5 in execution — they are not assigned to a single column because decision-making spans enterprise, solution, and technical layers simultaneously.

**The relationship in one sentence:** the seven columns are how the framework is taught and published; the six viewpoints are how it operates and conforms to ISO 42010.

## Publication boundary

Only material approved for public readers belongs in this repository. Commercial collateral, partner operations, internal planning, unpublished drafts, application code, deployment records, local workspace files and production notes are maintained outside the public knowledge base.

Repository paths that support public URLs must be changed with corresponding navigation and compatibility updates.

## Tooling

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/generate_pages.py` | Auto-generates reader HTML pages from MD files in `research/` and `publications/` |
| `tools/sync_nav.py` | Syncs canonical nav and footer across all site HTML pages. Run locally or via CI. |
| `tools/sync_nav.py --check` | CI mode — exits 1 if any page is out of sync |

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish-articles.yml`) runs on every push to `main` that touches `.md` files. It syncs nav/footer, lints for stale anchor links, then generates reader pages for any new articles.

Adding a new article: drop a `.md` file into `research/` or `publications/` and push — the workflow handles the rest.

## Publishing Platform

The primary publishing platform for all Velocity™ content is **velocityarchitectureframework.com**, not Medium.

| Channel | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| [velocityarchitectureframework.com/publications](https://velocityarchitectureframework.com/publications/) | **Primary** | All 50 book chapters + Thought Series + Signal |
| [Medium @ZencloudAU](https://medium.com/@ZencloudAU) | Secondary | Book chapters serialised — Chapter 30 of 50 |
| [LinkedIn in/pmyint](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmyint) | Professional | Active presence |
