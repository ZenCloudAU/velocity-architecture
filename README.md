## Publication boundary

Only material approved for public readers belongs in this repository. Commercial collateral, partner operations, internal planning, unpublished drafts, application code, deployment records, local workspace files and production notes are maintained outside the public knowledge base.

Repository paths that support public URLs must be changed with corresponding navigation and compatibility updates.

## Tooling

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/generate_pages.py` | Auto-generates reader HTML pages from MD files in `research/` and `publications/` |
| `tools/sync_nav.py` | Syncs canonical nav and footer across all site HTML pages. Run locally or via CI. |
| `tools/sync_nav.py --check` | CI mode — exits 1 if any page is out of sync |

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish-articles.yml`) runs on every push to `main` that touches `.md` files. It syncs nav/footer, lints for stale anchor links, then generates reader pages for any new articles.

Adding a new article: drop a `.md` file into `research/` or `publications/` and push — the workflow handles the rest.
