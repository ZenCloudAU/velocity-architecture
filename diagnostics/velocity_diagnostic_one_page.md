# Velocity Architecture — One-Page Diagnostic

A practical diagnostic for identifying why delivery slows down even when decisions appear clear.

---

## The Core Question

When delivery stalls, the cause is rarely execution.
It is almost always structural.

This diagnostic identifies five common failure modes that prevent organisations from converting clarity into movement.

## The Five Failure Modes

### 1. Decisions Are Invisible
**Symptoms**
- Rework
- Conflicting interpretations
- Architecture drift
- Late governance surprises

**Diagnostic question**  
Can you see every architectural decision in one place?

**Correction**
Adopt a one-page Architectural Decision Log (ADL) per decision.
Make decisions visible, owned, and current.

### 2. Decisions Are Clear — but Delivery Has No Pulse
**Symptoms**
- Missing inputs
- Late requirements
- Trade-offs resolved during UAT
- Delivery inferring intent

**Diagnostic question**  
Are required inputs owned and arriving on time?

**Correction**
Assign accountable input owners.
Re-baseline when foundational inputs do not arrive.

---

### 3. Ownership Exists — but Authority Doesn’t
**Symptoms**
- Escalation loops
- Deferred trade-offs
- Delivery absorbing risk

**Diagnostic question**  
Does the owner have binding decision rights?

**Correction**
Delegate real authority with air cover.
Do not assign accountability without power.

---

### 4. Authority Exists — but Responsibility Is Deflected
**Symptoms**
- Workshops instead of decisions
- Collaboration used as avoidance
- Escalations closed without resolution

**Diagnostic question**  
Is authority being exercised — or avoided?

**Correction**
Make escalation outcomes binding.
Measure decision follow-through, not participation.

---

### 5. Authority Exists — but Leaders Push Forward Anyway
**Symptoms**
- Rising risk
- Fading engagement
- Heroics replacing process

**Diagnostic question**  
Is the system signalling stop — but leadership accelerates?

**Correction**
Treat stopping as a capability.
Pause, fix, or kill initiatives when integrity is at risk.

---

## The 60-Second Test

Answer **Yes / No**:

- Are decisions visible and current?
- Are inputs owned and delivered on time?
- Do owners have real authority?
- Are escalations resolved with decisions?
- Is leadership willing to stop when the pulse is weak?

If any answer is **No**, velocity is structurally constrained.

## Principle

Delivery velocity is determined by decision velocity.  
Decision velocity is determined by organisational integrity.
