# Pulse System

**VAF VP5 — Rhythm Viewpoint | Operating Layer**

> The Pulse is the VAF operating heartbeat.  
> It is a structured cadence of review, decision, and escalation events.  
> Governance that does not operate at a defined frequency is not governance — it is event-driven reaction.

## Pulse Configuration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Programme / Engagement** | |
| **Pulse Tier** | Tier 1 (Weekly) \| Tier 2 (Fortnightly) \| Tier 3 (Monthly) |
| **Pulse Owner** | Single named facilitator and decision authority |
| **Participants** | Named roles — not open invitation |
| **Session Duration** | [e.g. 60 minutes — no extensions] |
| **Effective From** | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Pulse Tiers

| Tier | Frequency | Scope | Decision authority |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | Weekly | Active delivery decisions (VP2, VP3) | Solution Architect / Delivery Lead |
| Tier 2 | Fortnightly | Programme and cross-team decisions | Enterprise Architect / Programme Director |
| Tier 3 | Monthly | Strategic direction, canvas review | CIO / Architecture Review Board |

Escalation moves upward: Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3. Maximum two cycles at any tier before mandatory binding at the tier above.

## Escalation Protocol

When a decision is escalated from this session:

1. **Scope compresses** — the question arriving at the tier above must be narrower (CR-E2)
2. **Ownership intensifies** — fewer people carry it upward, not more (CR-E2)
3. **Terminal condition is declared** — the escalation carries a defined binding point (CR-E3)
4. **Maximum two cycles** — no decision passes through more than two Pulse cycles without binding (CR-E4)

**Escalation is not a holding pattern. It is a narrowing function.**

---

## Pulse Anti-Patterns

These patterns indicate the Pulse has become ceremony rather than governance:

| Anti-pattern | Signal | Response |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **The Status Update Pulse** | Every agenda item is informational; nothing requires a decision | Redesign the agenda — if there is nothing to decide, cancel the session |
| **The Endless Alignment Loop** | The same question appears in three consecutive sessions | Invoke CR-E4: force escalation or bind with the information available |
| **The Growing Invite List** | Each session has more attendees than the last | Invoke CR-E2: scope compression required; reduce not expand |
| **The Offline Decision** | Binding decisions are made outside the Pulse without recording | All binding decisions enter the ADL within 24 hours |
| **The Caveat Decision** | Decision is "agreed in principle" with unresolved conditions | Not a decision; return to Pulse with conditions resolved or explicitly dropped |
