# VP3 — Truth Viewpoint

**Instruments:** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) + Fitness Functions  
**Layer:** Technical architecture  
**ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 conformant viewpoint**

---

## Purpose

Technical architecture exists to expose truth.

It is concerned with what is built, what runs, and what breaks. Unlike other layers, it cannot negotiate with reality. Its job is to confirm assumptions — or force the system to revisit them.

**ADRs** prevent the same argument from occurring twice by preserving the reasoning behind technical decisions.

**Fitness Functions** enforce architectural intent continuously — they are not documentation, they are enforcement.

---

## Concerns Addressed

| Concern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| C3 — Decision traceability | Whether decisions can be traced to rationale and alternatives |
| C5 — Layer separation | Technical truth stays at the technical layer |
| C12 — Technical truth | Whether the system behaves as documented |
| C14 — Knowledge preservation | Whether decisions survive personnel change |

## Stakeholders Served

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| S2 — Solution Architect | Alignment of implementation to solution decisions |
| S3 — Technical Architect / Engineer | Technical validity and constraint enforcement |
| S8 — Auditor / Compliance Officer | Decision traceability and rationale capture |
| S9 — Delivery Team Member | Clarity on what was decided and why |

## Model Kind 1: Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

An ADR is a numbered, immutable record of a technical architectural decision. Once accepted, it does not change — it is superseded by a new record.

**Stored in:** the codebase (version control), not a separate system.  
**Numbered sequentially:** ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.

**Analytic test:**  
*When challenged later, can the team explain why this choice was made? If not, the ADR is missing.*

**Heuristic for what counts as architectural:**  
*If reversing this decision requires a sprint or more of rework, it is architectural. When in doubt, write it down.*

### ADR Storage: Codebase vs ADL

ADRs are the technical-layer instrument — they live in the codebase under `decisions/adrs/`. This is intentional: ADRs must be versioned alongside the code they govern.

The Architectural Decision Log (ADL) in VP4 is a separate instrument. The ADL indexes ADR IDs and records their current status and governing Trade-off Matrix references. It does not duplicate the ADR text. The relationship is:

| | ADR (VP3) | ADL/INDEX.md (VP4) |
|--|-----------|-------------------|
| **Location** | Codebase (`decisions/adrs/`) | ADL directory (`ADL/INDEX.md`) |
| **Contains** | Full decision text, rationale, consequences | ADR ID, status, owner, governing TOM, date |
| **Updated when** | A new technical decision is made or superseded | ADR status changes (opened, accepted, superseded) |
| **Immutability** | Fixed once accepted; superseded not deleted | Living index — always current |

**In practice:** you author and version an ADR in the codebase. The ADL entry records that ADR-007 exists, is in Draft status, is owned by P. Walsh, and governs TOM-20260115-002. When P. Walsh accepts the ADR, the ADL status updates to Accepted. The codebase ADR text does not change.

This separation prevents the ADL from becoming a shadow documentation system. The ADL is a status board; the codebase is the record.

## Model Kind 2: Fitness Function

A fitness function is an executable assertion encoding architectural intent. It runs continuously in the delivery pipeline. When it breaks, it means an upstream assumption is no longer valid — which is a signal to escalate, not ignore.

```
assert p95_latency() < 50ms
assert deployment_success_rate() > 99%
assert no_unauthorised_vendor_dependencies()
```

Every fitness function must be traceable to at least one ADR or Trade-off Matrix that states the intent it enforces (CR-T4).

Fitness function pass/fail status is reported in the Velocity Dashboard (VP4 — Component 7: Fitness Function Status). A failing fitness function in VP3 is a VP4 signal — it may invalidate upstream assumptions and must be escalated within one Pulse window (CR-L3).

---

## Correspondence Rules (from this viewpoint)

- **CR-T2:** Must reference the governing Trade-off Matrix record
- **CR-T3:** Superseded ADRs remain visible; they must reference the record that superseded them
- **CR-T4:** Every fitness function must be traceable to an ADR or Trade-off Matrix
- **CR-L3:** Technical findings that invalidate higher-layer assumptions must be escalated within one Pulse window — not absorbed silently
- **CR-L4:** Technical architecture must not redefine organisational intent
