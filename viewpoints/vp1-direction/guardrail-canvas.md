# Guardrail Canvas

**VAF VP1 — Direction Viewpoint | Enterprise Architecture Layer**

> One canvas = one organisational domain or strategic period.  
> This is a declaration of intent, not a design document.

## Core Optimisation

> *What do we prioritise when forced to choose?*  
> One clear statement. Not a list of values.

```
We prioritise [X] over [Y] when trade-offs are required.
```

---

## Non-Negotiables

> *What cannot be traded away under any circumstances?*  
> Keep this short. If everything is non-negotiable, nothing is.

- **Compliance:** [e.g. GDPR zero-tolerance / Essential Eight Maturity Level 2 minimum]
- **Security boundary:** [e.g. No customer PII outside Australian data residency]
- **Technical debt cap:** [e.g. No more than 20% of delivery capacity on unplanned work]
- **Vendor constraint:** [e.g. No sole-source contracts above $X without board approval]

## Explicit Trade-offs

> *Where we have made a conscious choice between competing goods.*  
> Name the tension. State the position. Own it.

| Tension | Our Position | Rationale (one line) |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Speed vs Scale | We choose Scale | Core platform must support 10x growth |
| Innovation vs Stability | Stability in core; innovation at edge | Core systems serve regulated functions |
| Cost vs Resilience | Resilience for Tier 1; cost optimisation for Tier 2 | Downtime cost exceeds hosting cost |
| Build vs Buy | Buy unless differentiated capability | Reduce operational burden |
| Centralisation vs Autonomy | [State position] | |

## What This Canvas Does NOT Do

This canvas does not:
- Specify which technology to use
- Design any system or integration
- Replace solution architecture decisions
- Prescribe implementation patterns

Those decisions belong to VP2 (Trade-off Matrix) and below.
