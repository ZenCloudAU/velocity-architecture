# Worked Example: Architecture Decision Log (ADL)

**Velocity Architecture Framework™ — Examples**

> **Scenario:** CloudFirst Banking — Core Platform Modernisation
> **Snapshot date:** 2026-02-11 (end of Week 7)
> **ADL owner:** S. Rajan (Solution Architect, S2)
> **Governing Canvas:** GC-20260101-001

This example shows a populated ADL index at the close of the onboarding period and into delivery. The ADL is the living spine of all architectural decisions (VP4). It indexes decisions by ID; it does not contain the full text of each artefact — ADRs live in the codebase (VP3), Canvases and Matrices in the Vault (VP4).

## Enterprise Layer — Guardrail Canvases (VP1)

| ID | Title | Owner | Status | Expiry / Review | Governed TOMs |
|----|-------|-------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| GC-20260101-001 | Enterprise constraints — CloudFirst Core Modernisation | D. Nguyen (S5) | Active | 2026-07-14 (CR-X3) | TOM-20260115-001, TOM-20260115-002 |

**Constraint summary (GC-20260101-001):**
1. No vendor lock-in above hyperscaler level
2. All data must remain within Australian sovereign boundaries (APL data class)
3. Core banking system (Temenos T24) is out of scope for this engagement
4. Budget envelope: $4.2M. No budget increase authority below CTO (S5).
5. Go-live: 2026-08-31. Date is hard — not negotiable.

## Solution Layer — Trade-off Matrices (VP2)

| ID | Question decided | Owner | Status | Governing Canvas | Date decided | ADR |
|----|-----------------|-------|--------|-----------------|--------------|-----|
| TOM-20260115-001 | Integration layer: event-driven vs REST for core-to-channel | P. Walsh (S3) | Decided | GC-20260101-001 | 2026-02-06 | ADR-004 |
| TOM-20260115-002 | API gateway: managed service (AWS) vs custom-built | P. Walsh (S3) | Decided | GC-20260101-001 | 2026-02-11 | ADR-007 (pending) |
| TOM-20260204-001 | Audit log retention: 7-year vs 10-year requirement | M. Osei (S2) | Open | GC-20260101-001 | — | — |

### Open TOM notes

**TOM-20260204-001** — Decision owner: M. Osei. Opened: 2026-02-04. Expiry: 2026-02-18 (day 14). Status: awaiting regulatory reference from compliance. If unresolved by 2026-02-18, CR-E1 activates.

## Technical Layer — Architecture Decision Records (VP3)

ADRs are stored in the codebase at `decisions/`. This index records status and cross-references; full text is in the codebase.

| ADR | Title | Owner | Status | Governs | Date |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|---------|------|
| ADR-001 | Cloud platform selection — AWS primary, Azure secondary | D. Nguyen (S5) | Accepted | GC-20260101-001, TOM-20260115-001 | 2026-01-21 |
| ADR-002 | Identity provider — Azure AD B2C (retained from existing estate) | T. Clarke (S1) | Accepted | GC-20260101-001 | 2026-01-23 |
| ADR-003 | Network architecture — hub-and-spoke VPC with transit gateway | P. Walsh (S3) | Accepted | ADR-001 | 2026-01-28 |
| ADR-004 | Integration layer — event-driven (Kafka on MSK) for core-to-channel | P. Walsh (S3) | Accepted | TOM-20260115-001 | 2026-02-06 |
| ADR-005 | Data sovereignty boundaries for cross-border transaction data | T. Clarke (S1) | Open — Expiry 2026-02-12 | GC-20260101-001 | — |
| ADR-006 | Audit log retention period | M. Osei (S2) | Open — Expiry 2026-02-18 | TOM-20260204-001 | — |
| ADR-007 | API gateway — AWS API Gateway (managed) | P. Walsh (S3) | Draft — author by 2026-02-13 | TOM-20260115-002 | — |

### ADR–ADL relationship note

ADRs are the technical-layer decision record, authored and versioned in the codebase (VP3). This ADL index records the ADR's status and cross-references to its governing TOM and Canvas — it does not duplicate the ADR content. When an ADR is superseded, the original is retained; a new ADR is created with a `Supersedes: ADR-NNN` reference (CR-T3). The supersession is recorded in the Velocity Vault (VP4/Vault).
