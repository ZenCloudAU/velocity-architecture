## Decisions Made This Session

### TOM-20260115-002: API gateway strategy — CONFIRMED
**Decision:** AWS API Gateway (managed service) selected as the API gateway layer for all external-facing integration.
**Owner:** P. Walsh (Technical Architect, S3)
**Bound by:** D. Nguyen (CTO, S5) — verbal confirmation, this session
**Rationale:** Managed service eliminates operational overhead estimated at 1.2 FTE. Aligns with GC-20260101-001 constraint (no lock-in above hyperscaler level — AWS API Gateway is a hyperscaler service, not a third-party SaaS).
**ADR:** ADR-007 to be authored by P. Walsh — due 2026-02-13
**ADL update:** TOM-20260115-002 status → Decided (2026-02-11)
**Downstream:** Infrastructure sprint can commence. P. Walsh to notify delivery lead (S4) within 24 hours.

## Escalation Status

### ADR-005: Data sovereignty — ESCALATION PENDING
**Status at session close:** T. Clarke confirmed compliance review is complete. Legal sign-off expected 2026-02-12.
**Outcome:** CR-E1 trigger (day 14 = 2026-02-12) will be observed as scheduled. If sign-off is confirmed by EOD 2026-02-12, CR-E1 does not activate. If sign-off is not confirmed by EOD 2026-02-12, ADR-005 escalates to D. Nguyen at Tier 2 Pulse (2026-02-19).
**T. Clarke action:** Confirm sign-off with S. Rajan by email by 16:00 on 2026-02-12.

## Decision Velocity Metric — Week 7

| Metric | This week | Cumulative |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Decisions opened | 1 (ADR-006) | 7 |
| Decisions confirmed | 2 (ADR-004, TOM-20260115-002) | 5 |
| Decisions aged >14 days | 0 | 0 |
| Escalations activated | 0 | 0 |
| Fitness functions failing | 1 (FF-005) | — |

**Velocity observation:** Two consecutive weeks without a decision aging beyond 14 days. The Pulse rhythm is functioning. The ADR-005 sign-off is the only active risk to this metric.
